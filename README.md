# Backend Development with Django - Learning Journey

A collaborative repository for learning backend development using Django from scratch.

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand backend development fundamentals
- Learn Django framework step-by-step
- Build a complete CRUD application
- Learn Git collaboration along the way
- Deploy a working backend application

## 👥 Collaborative Learning Approach
1. We'll work through topics together
2. Each major concept gets its own branch
3. We'll review each other's code via Pull Requests
4. We'll maintain a learning log in `progress.md`
